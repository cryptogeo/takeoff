Happy clients lead to other happy clients, etc., so it's likely someone in your firm has already used us, been happy with what we've done, and passed on your name as someone who could also find it of interest. We also get numbers from publicly available information, but we filter them VERY stringently because we only deal with high-net-worth individuals and people who have taken advice before, so it's a very, very exclusive group of people. We also have a team of people who make the occasional cold call as well.

For example, if you met Cindy Crawford in the supermarket, you wouldn't be bemoaning the fact you met her next to the cucumbers. You'd just be delighted you met Cindy Crawford! It's the same thing here, you know, whether it's a cold call or not, or whether it's a referral. The main thing is the value I can add. So just bear with me a couple of minutes. I'll go over that value and then we can decide what to do from there.",
        theory: "Redirect the Focus: This shifts attention away from the nature of the call (a potential negative) to the value you bring, keeping the conversation productive.

        theory: "Control the Frame: By refusing to explain in their rushed time frame, you establish control and demonstrate confidence in the value of the conversation. Preserve Authority: Staying firm ensures you don't appear overly eager, maintaining professionalism and the perception that your time is valuable.

        response: "Sure, absolutely. Is it more details about the company or the ideas? In terms of ideas, I wish I could send you something over—it would make my life so much easier. But there's a number of difficulties. I don't know which ideas are suitable for you; I don't know your situation, so it's a far better use of both our time to ascertain your situation and then give you something relevant. Notwithstanding the fact that you probably wouldn't read the email. Notwithstanding the fact that it probably wouldn't get through, as it would be out of context and carrying about 50 different ideas in there. But also, there's a decision-making problem: given three different relevant ideas based on your situation, you can make a decision. But if we send you over 50 different ideas, you won't be able to, so it's unlikely to lead anywhere anyway. From my perspective, it's a bit of give and take. If you're asking us to give away our secret formula, then you need to do at least something to justify us doing that. So with that in mind, we've found that the best way for you to learn about us—and for us to take as little as possible from you in order to do that—is to set aside half an hour, in such a way that doesn't cost you anything. During that meeting, we can find out about you and furnish you with the ideas that are relevant, so you can go off and find out more about them. So, if you think about it, apart from half an hour, what have you got to lose?",
        theory: "Acknowledge and Redirect: Positively acknowledge their request to avoid conflict, then gently guide them toward a more effective solution. Explain the Limitations: Highlight why sending an email isn't useful for them, emphasizing the importance of tailored advice over generic content. Encourage Commitment: Framing the meeting as low-risk (what have you got to lose?) reduces resistance and increases the likelihood of agreement. Establish Reciprocity: Positioning your expertise as valuable (secret formula) encourages them to invest a small amount of time in return."

        response: "Do you mean that when you become a partner, you have a select group of IFAs, or do you mean that you can't invest in something outside of the company because it might be a conflict of interest? Pre-Approved Advisors Yeah, yeah, I know, of course, because when you go from being a senior associate to a partner, you lose all of your benefits, and so you have to have an IFA provide all of those for you. But that's not what we do. What we do is different. Can't invest in anything outside the company Yeah, of course. Look, as I said, we've got a million clients in [company name]. We're completely used to that. In fact, the rules are exactly the same for Goldman, Merrill Lynch, and so on. So every single thing that we do, we will get pre-approved by your company before you do it. There's no point in you making an extra couple of million pounds with us and losing your job. Agreed? Agreed. OK, great. Now look, it probably won't surprise you to know that we already have clients in most of the things that we will show you, so we will have already got pre-approval. But rest assured, if we show you something that you want to do, then we will get pre-approval or proof that we have pre-approval from the company before we do it. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. You've got to come and see us first and find out if there's anything you want to do. So as I said a couple of minutes ago, let's find 20 minutes so we can get together.",
        theory: "Identify Which Rule Applies: This question immediately establishes credibility and forces them to be specific about their objection. Separates your offering from traditional financial advice. Removes the perceived risk by emphasizing compliance approval. Final Close: Bring the focus back to the meeting."
      },
      {
        title: "Are you a Financial Advisor/IFA?",
        response: "No, we don't do what IFAs do. They're limited to pensions, savings, and insurance by the FCA. The fact that we have so many clients within investment banking, law firms, and accounting firms is because what we do is different. You have to have that stuff because it's good advice and a sensible foundation. But what we do is different. Let me give you an idea as to the kind of thing we do.",
        theory: "Strong Positioning Through Distinction: The immediate and emphatic No creates a clear separation between your role and that of an Independent Financial Advisor (IFA). This distinguishes your offering as unique and more specialized, which piques curiosity while establishing authority. Demonstrates Expertise Beyond Regulation: Explaining that IFAs are limited by FCA regulations emphasizes that your work operates beyond these constraints. This reinforces that your solutions are tailored to sophisticated, high-net-worth individuals whose needs exceed the standard scope of IFAs. Aligns with Client's Sophistication: Highlighting the limited relevance of IFAs' services (pensions, insurance, ISAs) to professionals in high-earning sectors resonates with their self-image as savvy, financially literate individuals who have already addressed these basics. Adds Credibility Through Social Proof: Referencing the number of clients in prestigious sectors (law, investment banking, accounting) lends credibility to your approach. It implies that your methods are trusted by peers, making them more attractive to the client. Generates Curiosity and Engagement: When transitioning into Let me give you an idea of what we do..., you create intrigue and a natural segue to present your offering. This keeps the conversation forward-moving and focused on your unique value. Confidence Builds Trust: The assertive, almost shocked tone when denying being an IFA reinforces confidence and professionalism. Clients are more likely to trust someone who is certain and passionate about the distinction in their services."

        title: "I'm sorted",
        response: "Well, sure! And bearing in mind where you work and the fact you've taken advice, you've probably got a lot of it sorted. The thing is, you may well be happy with what you've got, but you're not in London for the scenery, are you? You're working because you like the money that comes with the job. And so the pursuit of additional financial security is clearly something that's important to you. Even if you do feel like you have enough, what's wrong with more? So what I'll try and do now is show you something to vastly improve your situation for very little effort. I don't think you're daft enough to reject that! So let's test the theory. Give me 240 seconds, I'll give you an idea, and if you still hate it, then we can part as friends.",
        theory: "Challenge the Client's Assumption Without Confrontation: The response doesn't outright reject the client's claim of being sorted. Instead, it subtly challenges it by introducing the idea that even if someone is content, there's always room for improvement. This approach positions you as someone offering enhancement rather than disruption. Leverage Logic and Relatability: Referring to their job and the pursuit of financial security ties into a universal truth: people work for money and, by extension, for financial growth. The line about not working for the scenery in London adds relatability and humor while gently poking at the incongruity of their claim. Shift Focus to Value and Ease: Highlighting that the offering is a vast improvement with very little effort lowers the perceived risk of exploring further. This framing is crucial for clients who might resist change due to time or effort concerns. Inject Humor and Wit to Build Rapport: The playful tone builds rapport and disarms the client. Humor humanizes the conversation, making the salesperson appear confident and approachable. Propose a Low-Stakes Test: Offering a short, time-bound opportunity (Give me 240 seconds) reduces the commitment barrier for the client while appealing to their curiosity. It also positions the salesperson as respectful of the client's time, which resonates with busy professionals. Frame the Objection as a Stepping Stone: The response transforms the objection from a roadblock into an opportunity to delve deeper. By saying, Let's test the theory, it positions the conversation as exploratory rather than confrontational, maintaining momentum and engagement."

        title: "This sounds dodgy.",
        response: "What do you mean? Do you mean something dodgy, or do you just mean a thing? It sounds like something dodgy. Are you suggesting that I spend my day peddling things that are criminal? Well, no, no, I'm not saying that. Everything we do, we will run past your employer to check that you're allowed to do it. OK, so we have a million clients from [company name], and every single time anyone does anything, we have to get your company's approval before you can do it. So you've got an inherent checking system there anyway, in that your company's going to tell you whether or not it's something that's likely to lead to you getting fired. But the fact that we've got a million clients within [company name] already doing this should give you the comfort that you need. But basically, what you're saying is that because you don't understand it and haven't heard it before, it must be in some way wrong. But that's not necessarily the case. You might just not know about it, in the same way as I'm sure there are a million things you do that I don't know about, but that doesn't mean that they're dodgy. It just means I don't know about them. So the point you're making is actually why we have an initial introductory meeting for 20 minutes so you can find out more. At the moment, you like the sound of it, you just think, well, if it's wrong, then I don't want to do it. There's a gap in your knowledge, and the point of the 20-minute conversation is to close that gap. In other words, I will make sure you're aware of the risks. You can then take an initial view as to whether or not it sounds kosher—and trust me when I say you will. And then after that meeting, you can go off and get more information and make an informed decision. But at the moment, you're not informed at all, and you don't have enough information to make a decision. So bear in mind, just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's dodgy. But if it sounds interesting, you owe it to yourself to take 20 minutes to find out more. Wouldn't you agree? How are you fixed next week?",
        theory: "Redirect the Negative Perception Through Questioning: The response starts by probing what the client actually means by scheme. This serves two purposes: 1. It forces the client to clarify their objection rather than relying on vague skepticism. 2. It allows the salesperson to take control of the conversation and reframe the discussion. Leverage Social Proof to Build Credibility: By stating that we have a million clients from [company name] and that everything is approved by the client's own employer, the response introduces powerful credibility points. Reframe the Client's Skepticism as a Knowledge Gap: Rather than dismissing the client's concern, the response reframes it. This approach encourages self-reflection. It nudges the client to question whether their skepticism is truly based on logic or just unfamiliarity. Position the Meeting as the Logical Next Step: The response subtly moves from addressing the objection to securing the meeting. This prevents the client from feeling pressured and instead makes the meeting feel like an opportunity to make an informed decision rather than an obligation."

        response: "No, no, no, stop. It's not a tax plan. It's not a film partnership. It's not anything like that at all. Do you have a pension? Yes. When you contribute to the pension, you get tax relief. Agreed? So you get a tax advantage. Yes, I do. Is that unethical? No. No, because it's a government-promulgated allowance. The government says to you every year you can put this much into a pension, and as long as it is a pension, there's no doubt you're going to get the tax. But it's not unethical because they're telling you it's allowed. What we're talking about is exactly the same thing. It's a government-promulgated tax advantage. You can do a certain amount every year. Just nobody uses it properly. It's as simple as that. So like I said a minute ago, the purpose of the call was to invite you along for 20 minutes and show you how that idea works. It doesn't cost you anything, and at the end of it, you can go off and have a think about it. How are you fixed next week?",
        theory: "Meet the Accusation With Strength and Congruence: The initial reaction is key. If you sound hesitant, the client will sense weakness. A strong, confident response signals certainty, preventing doubt from taking hold. Reframe the Concept Using Familiar, Accepted Examples: This logic works because pensions are universally accepted, and tax relief is seen as a legitimate incentive rather than a loophole. By positioning the offer as a government-backed allowance rather than a scheme, it shifts the perception from something shady to something standard but underutilized. Smooth Transition Into the Meeting Close: Ending on a low-risk, logical next step prevents the conversation from stalling in moral debate and keeps the momentum toward booking an appointment."
      },
      {
        title: "What is it exactly that you do?",
        response: "Well, in short, we show people like you ideas. You know, if we took 20 minutes in order to show you how to get someone else to pay off your mortgage, that would be 20 minutes well spent, yeah? Yes. So it's very hard to put a label on what we do because, in essence, what we're doing is introducing high-net-worth individuals to concepts and ideas that can add value to their situation. And unfortunately, like so many of the great things in life, it's very hard to label that. We're not financial advisors. We're not wealth managers. We're none of that. We have a very esoteric and individual kind of structure that simply does that. So don't worry about the title. Worry about what we can do, because, like I said, if we can show you how to generate that amount of capital in 20 minutes, that would be time well spent. So the purpose of the call...",
        theory: "Redirect the Focus From Definition to Value: The client is looking for a label—financial advisor, wealth manager, consultant—but the response avoids rigid classification and instead steers the conversation toward what actually matters: the benefit they receive rather than the job title of the person delivering it."

        title: "I've had calls like this before",
        response: "Just so I'm clear, calls about what exactly? You've had somebody call you up about paying off your mortgage before? Yes. Oh great, so you've paid off your mortgage? I thought you said you still had one. Well, no, I didn't take him up on the offer. So they got you all the way to the finish line, and then you retreated and went, 'No, I'm going back to the start now. I don't like this glory and all these gold medals'? When you went home, did you tell your partner you turned down a chance to pay off the mortgage? I'm assuming she's still with you? Don't you think you should actually bother to spend 20 minutes to figure out whether it's BS or not? So how are you fixed next week?",
        theory: "Clarification of the Objection: The person might be grouping this call with previous ones about general financial products, or they might be referring specifically to mortgage-related solutions. Once you know the exact concern, you can handle it appropriately. Redirecting the Focus: If they say they've heard about mortgage strategies before, asking if they've already paid off their mortgage forces them to confront their inaction. By pointing out that they haven't acted on the previous opportunity, you highlight the gap between knowledge and action. This subtly prompts them to reconsider their decision. Using Logic and Accountability: Asking them why they didn't follow through after hearing about something beneficial brings accountability into the conversation. If they've been offered a solution before and didn't take it, you're calling attention to that missed opportunity, making it harder for them to brush off this call. Highlighting the Opportunity Cost: You're framing the call as a time investment—20 minutes to potentially change their financial situation. If they dismiss this chance, they're effectively rejecting a simple opportunity to improve their life, which they may regret later. This taps into the fear of missing out (FOMO), motivating them to take action."

You need to understand, it's exactly that reaction that means that 90% of people can, but only 2% do. I'm just going to say one more time to make a point. 90% of people can use that idea, but only 2% do. Do you have any idea why? Number 1. It's a concept, not a product, so your advisor isn't going to show it to you because concepts don't pay commission, and no commission doesn't pay the bills. So your existing advisor is going to be showing you pensions, investments, and savings. He's not going to be dealing in concepts, so he doesn't tell you about it. Number 2. The tax man doesn't advertise it. How do you get into work in the morning? Tube? Yes. So you walk down the stairs past that gaggle of Japanese tourists who are taking pictures of who knows what and finally get to the platform. You look up next to the Dan Brown advert, and there's a sign that says, 'We will pay your mortgage off,' signed HMRC. No, because they're in the business of taking money off you, not giving money to you. So they don't advertise it. So your advisor didn't tell you about it, didn't get paid, which is kind of understandable. Secondly, the tax man doesn't tell you about it because they're supposed to be taking money off you. Sound familiar? And last but not least, every time someone like me calls you, tells you about it, and when faced with the opportunity, you finally find out, you say: 'Sounds too good to be true.' Yeah, it does. But it is true. So don't be a part of the percentage that doesn't do it. Be part of the percentage that does. Spend 20 minutes with me, and I'll show you how it works.

Do you think that might be a bit of a waste of time? Right. And as I said before, what if I can do it? Just imagine you go home tonight and say to your wife, 'Somebody phoned me up and said they could save the value of the mortgage for 20 minutes,' and she goes, 'Oh, how does that work? Tell me everything.' And you go, 'Oh, I didn't bother.' So why don't you actually find out how it works? Then go home as the returning hero and tell your wife, 'I just figured out how to get the value of the mortgage paid off, and all it did was take me 20 minutes.'

        theory: "Redirect the Negative Perception Through Questioning: The response starts by probing what the client actually means by scheme. This serves two purposes: 1. It forces the client to clarify their objection rather than relying on vague skepticism. 2. It allows the salesperson to take control of the conversation and reframe the discussion. Leverage Social Proof to Build Credibility: By stating that we have a million clients from [company name] and that everything is approved by the client's own employer, the response introduces powerful credibility points. Reframe the Client's Skepticism as a Knowledge Gap: Rather than dismissing the client's concern, the response reframes it. This approach encourages self-reflection. It nudges the client to question whether their skepticism is truly based on logic or just unfamiliarity. Position the Meeting as the Logical Next Step: The response subtly moves from addressing the objection to securing the meeting. This prevents the client from feeling pressured and instead makes the meeting feel like an opportunity to make an informed decision rather than an obligation."

        title: "What is it exactly that you do?",
        response: "Well, in short, we show people like you ideas. You know, if we took 20 minutes in order to show you how to get someone else to pay off your mortgage, that would be 20 minutes well spent, yeah? Yes. So it's very hard to put a label on what we do because, in essence, what we're doing is introducing high-net-worth individuals to concepts and ideas that can add value to their situation. And unfortunately, like so many of the great things in life, it's very hard to label that. We're not financial advisors. We're not wealth managers. We're none of that. We have a very esoteric and individual kind of structure that simply does that. So don't worry about the title. Worry about what we can do, because, like I said, if we can show you how to generate that amount of capital in 20 minutes, that would be time well spent. So the purpose of the call...",
        theory: "Redirect the Focus From Definition to Value: The client is looking for a label—financial advisor, wealth manager, consultant—but the response avoids rigid classification and instead steers the conversation toward what actually matters: the benefit they receive rather than the job title of the person delivering it."

        title: "I've had calls like this before",
        response: "Just so I'm clear, calls about what exactly? You've had somebody call you up about paying off your mortgage before? Yes. Oh great, so you've paid off your mortgage? I thought you said you still had one. Well, no, I didn't take him up on the offer. So they got you all the way to the finish line, and then you retreated and went, 'No, I'm going back to the start now. I don't like this glory and all these gold medals'? When you went home, did you tell your partner you turned down a chance to pay off the mortgage? I'm assuming she's still with you? Don't you think you should actually bother to spend 20 minutes to figure out whether it's BS or not? So how are you fixed next week?",
        theory: "Clarification of the Objection: The person might be grouping this call with previous ones about general financial products, or they might be referring specifically to mortgage-related solutions. Once you know the exact concern, you can handle it appropriately. Redirecting the Focus: If they say they've heard about mortgage strategies before, asking if they've already paid off their mortgage forces them to confront their inaction. By pointing out that they haven't acted on the previous opportunity, you highlight the gap between knowledge and action. This subtly prompts them to reconsider their decision. Using Logic and Accountability: Asking them why they didn't follow through after hearing about something beneficial brings accountability into the conversation. If they've been offered a solution before and didn't take it, you're calling attention to that missed opportunity, making it harder for them to brush off this call. Highlighting the Opportunity Cost: You're framing the call as a time investment—20 minutes to potentially change their financial situation. If they dismiss this chance, they're effectively rejecting a simple opportunity to improve their life, which they may regret later. This taps into the fear of missing out (FOMO), motivating them to take action."

        response: "We don't book meetings more than two weeks in advance because we've found that impetus fades. When you want something, you want it now, not in a month. So come on, you can definitely find 20 minutes between now and then. A man of your calibre, power, and ability—surely you have control of your own diary. Think about it this way: How many more mortgage payments do you want to pay yourself before you decide that someone else paying it is a good idea? None. Exactly! So break the habit of a lifetime and let's find some time over the next few days. Everyone's got 20 minutes. The difference is that you're spending time on your employer rather than investing time in yourself—a common mistake. Rather than spending 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year for £1,000,000, spend 20 minutes for £1,000,000. That's better, right?",

        response: "Alright, brilliant idea. Where are you going to start? I'm going to look up the name of the company online. I'll help you. It's a little lid. Have a look at that. The point is this: my little brother works for a hedge fund. I'm not going to tell you which one it is, but if you go on their website, guess what it tells you... Nothing! You're not allowed in. You know why? Because you're not a client. You haven't demonstrated that you're worth enough. And it's so esoteric you have to qualify. And also, it's not your business. They're not going to give away their best ideas to just anybody. And we're the same. You don't expect Coca-Cola's website to give you the recipe, do you? So have a look at the website now! It'll get you further forward, and you won't know where to go and look. And even if you did, it would take you forever. And with all due respect, even if you found it—and you can't find it—but even if you did, you wouldn't understand it. You're brighter than me! I'm not trying to take anything away from you. But the fact is, this is what I do for a living. So trust me when I tell you, by the time you've found it (and you won't), you've read it (which will take you forever), and you think you understand it, you still won't be any further forward as to whether it was relevant for you. So it's such a waste of time. There's a reason why we do it this way. We found out from experience, having had loads of clients in your company, that sitting down with you for 20 minutes, showing you how it works, and sending you off with all the information for you to make an informed decision is just a better use of everyone's time. That's why we do it on a non-committal basis. Doesn't that sound like a better use of time? Yes. Great, how are you fixed next week?",
        theory: "Demonstrate That Online Research Will Be Useless: The hedge fund analogy highlights that elite financial firms do not disclose valuable information publicly. Undermine the Prospect's Ability to Make Sense of Any Information They Do Find: Even if they were to locate something relevant, they likely wouldn't understand its full implications without expert guidance."

        response: "Sure, absolutely. Is it more details about the company or the ideas? In terms of ideas, I wish I could send you something over—it would make life so much easier. But there are a number of difficulties. 1. I don't know which ideas are suitable for you; I don't know your situation, so it's a better use of both our time to ascertain your situation and then give you something relevant. 2. Notwithstanding the fact that it probably wouldn't get read the email. 3. Notwithstanding the fact that it probably wouldn't get through, as it would be out of context and carrying about 50 different ideas in there. But also, there's a decision-making problem: given three different relevant ideas based on your situation, you can make a decision. But if we send you over 50 different ideas, you won't be able to, so it's unlikely to lead anywhere anyway. From my perspective, it's a bit of give and take. If you're asking us to give away our secret formula, then you need to at least something to justify us doing that. So with that in mind, we've found that the best way for you to learn about us—and for us to take as little as possible from you in order to do that—is to set aside half an hour, in such a way that doesn't cost you anything. During that meeting, we can find out about you and furnish you with the ideas that are relevant, so you can go off and find out more about them. So, if you think about it, apart from half an hour, what have you got to lose?",
        theory: "Acknowledge and Redirect: Positively acknowledge their request to avoid conflict, then gently guide them toward a more effective solution.

It's just that in order for you to actually find the time, we need to go through your assistant. What's your assistant's name? My assistant's name is... OK, great. So it's easier if I deal directly with Susan. Is that correct? Yes. Great. OK, well, look, listen, having done this before, Susan doesn't know who I am. She's not had the benefit of this conversation. And if she's decent, she might well be reluctant to put people in your diary that you haven't spoken to her about. So if I get my assistant to e-mail her today and I don't hear back from her, I'll give you a tinkle tomorrow and we can put something in the diary ourselves. Does that sound fair? No, my assistant is amazing... Look, I'm sure she's amazing. But like I said, having done this sort of thing before, if she's decent, she might be reluctant. Unless I can see you, I can't show you these ideas, so if we have any uphill, I'll give you a tinkle tomorrow. Does that sound fair? Yeah, that's fair.",
        theory: "Avoid the Secretary Objection at All Costs: The first key principle is that booking through an assistant rarely works. The goal is to prevent the client from deflecting responsibility, keeping control of the scheduling process."
